The purpose of this Programming Assignment was to write an optimal version of the ArrList class. It was tested against the given ArrListTest.java file

ArrList.java contains all methods responsible for an ArrList

ArrListTest.java contains test cases

Final Score: 46.5/50 = 93%

I was docked points because two methods were not as efficient as possible. The efficiency was measured using the given Array.java data structure which
measured the accessCount of the array. The two methods that could have been improved were AddFirst and RemoveFirst. These could have been optimized using
a circular array where indicies are reused and shifted.
