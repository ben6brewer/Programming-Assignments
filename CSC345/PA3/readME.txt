The purpose of this Programming Assignment was to create two deques with different resizing strategies and compare their overall performance.

DequeAnalysis.java contains both of the deques as well as a method responsible for helping me create a graph to visualize the differences.

TicketSaleTest.java contains an example of a real-life implementation of the deques using a priority-based system.

Final Score: 50/50
