This was a group project. My group decided to create a Huffman Encoding Algorithm which is responsible for lossless data compression. We were responsible for creating all data structures used in the algorithm.

CustomChar.java contains a custom character class

EmptyQueueException.java contains an exception that handles empty queues

HuffmanEncoding.java contains the main algorithm

HuffmanEncodingTest.java contains custom test cases used to test our algorithm

HuffmanEncodingTree.java contains a custom tree class used as a data structure in the algorithm

MaxPriorityQueue.java contains a custom max priority queue class used as a data structure in the algorithm

Final Score: 50/50
