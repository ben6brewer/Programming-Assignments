The purpose of this Programming Assignment was to create and test the different sorting methods.

Merge.java contains two different implementations of merge sort. One is recursive and the other iterative.

ArraySort.java contains 7 different arrays to sort. I used a different sorting method on each one depending on my knowlege of the array contents.

SortGrid.java contains two different grids to sort. I used two different sorting methods on each depending on my knowlege of the 2D array contents.

Final Score: 56.25/50, extra credit was given on this project based on efficiency. Max points = 60.
